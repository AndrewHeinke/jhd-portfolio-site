        <p><strong>JEFFREY HEINKE,</strong><br>Owner/Creative Director</p>
        <p>Jeff established Heinke Design in 1993. It's been his pride and joy for over 24 years. (BTW: That's 168 in dog years).</p>
        <p>He is a graduate of the University of Iowa with a BFA degree. Jeff spent over 15 years as a newspaper designer/manager and art director. Apart from overseeing the direction of graphic and photography departments, he also re-designed several newspapers

        <p>Jeff left the newspaper industry to start his own company, offering a mix of creativity with a common-sense approach to business and communication — treat clients the way you wish to be treated. The result: countless satisfied customers and successful
          projects, plus a sense of pride for doing things the right way.</p>
        <p>The JHD staff has over 40 years of design experience and expert knowledge. We are motivated, creative, versatile and proud of our ability to deliver visually stunning and technically sound solutions to businesses of all shapes and sizes.</p>
